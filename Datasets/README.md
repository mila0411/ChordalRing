Datasets of Optimal Chordal Ring networks

The datasets are lists of Optimal Chordal Ring Networks (Graphs) of the form C(N;1,-1,s) with the minimum diameter for different number of nodes : where file chord-opt-X1-X2.csv is a list of graphs with X1-X2 thousands of nodes 

CSV files format:

N, s, diam;

where:

N - number of nodes (order of a graph);

s - optimal generator (3 <= s <= N/2)

diam - optimal (minimal) diameter of a graph;
